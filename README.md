== Build a small project that provides a way to build a contract (represented in a string), with posibilities to add to this contract multiple modifications
in the form of middlewares, similar to how rack handle middlewares for apps. For example, one can add a middleware to log things, to check if contract has
some keywords present, to persist the contract to a file, etc, etc. Possibilites can be endless and the aim is to provide an ease to use interface with
correct abstraction to provid SOLID development such that the piece of code is understandable, maintenable, testable and extensible. Tests should be added, linter should be added, documentation should be added and examples should be added.
